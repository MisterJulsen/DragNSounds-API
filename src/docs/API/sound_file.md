# Sound File
The `SoundFile` contains alls information about a single audio file uplaoded to the server. The most important thing is how to localize them. For this, each sound file contains a [SoundLocation](./sound_location.md) and an Id (which corresponds to the file name). The path of a `SoundFile` therefore consists of the `String` representation of a [SoundLocation](./sound_location.md) with the ID appended. Example: `namespace:path/to/file/soundid`

`SoundFiles` may only be generated by the server from an index file to ensure that all information is included.

## Using SoundFile in commands
A `SoundFile` can also be used as a command argument. The `String` notation is used there. It is important to know that the real file name is used and not the display name, as it may be used multiple times or in an invalid format.

To use a `SoundFile` in your own command you can use the [SoundFileArgument](../javadoc/de/mrjulsen/dragnsounds/commands/arguments/SoundFileArgument.html).
